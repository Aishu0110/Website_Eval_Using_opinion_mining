# Website_Eval_Using_opinion_mining
The Website Evaluator is an AI-based Model, that analyses the comments and uses opinion mining for evaluating a website. 
The model includes data aggregation, preprocessing, and sentiment analysis algorithms.
Weâ€™re also incorporating comment aggregation, aspect-based sentiment analysis for a dynamic rating system.
We have created an interactive dashboard using Streamlit that integrates all of the necessary features  under one umbrella.
